Title: Output Regression Results and Other Tables to LaTeX
Version: 0.3.0
Author: James Feigenbaum
Maintainer: James Feigenbaum <jamesf@bu.edu>
Description: This is a custom package to output regression results and summary tables.
    This package is inspired by the `estout` package for Stata but will probably only work for me (stylistically, at least).
    I had to change the name from `estout` to `textablr` because another `estout` is already on CRAN.
    The package will produce tables that are LaTeX fragments.
    These tables are (for now) both regression results and summary statistics.
    This works with the workflow described here: http://www.jwe.cc/2012/03/stata-latex-tables-estout/.
